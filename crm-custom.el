;;; crm-custom.el --- Alternate `completing-read-multiple' that uses `completing-read'

;; Copyright (C) 2014  Ryan C. Thompson

;; Author: Ryan C. Thompson <rct@thompsonclan.org>
;; Keywords: completion, minibuffer, multiple elements
;; URL: https://github.com/DarwinAwardWinner/crm-custom
;; Version: 0.5
;; Created: 2014-08-15
;; Package-Requires: ((cl-lib "0.5"))

;; This file is NOT part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; If you use a custom completion mechanism such as
;; `ido-ubiquitous-mode', you might notice that functions like
;; `describe-face' don't use it. This is because they use a function
;; called `completing-read-multiple' to read multiple values at once,
;; and this function doesn't use the standard completion
;; mechanisms. This package allows you to use the standard completion
;; mechanisms to replace `completing-read-multiple', allowing your
;; custom completion system to work for functions that use it.

;; When you turn on `crm-custom-mode', any command that uses
;; `completing-read-multiple' will now prompt you again each time you
;; enter an item. This is because it is reading a list of multiple
;; items. To end the completion and finish the list of items, simply
;; enter an empty string.

  "Use `completing-read-function' in `completing-read-multiple'.

When this mode is enabled, `completing-read-multiple' will work
by calling `completing-read' repeatedly until it receives an
empty string, and returning all the values read in this way. This
is useful because it will use `completing-read-function' to do
completion, so packages like `ido-ubiquitous' that offer an
alternative completion system will now work in
`completing-read-multiple'. (Remember that in ido, you must enter
an empty string by pressing `C-j', since RET simply selects the
first completion.)

Note that `crm-separator' is purely cosmetic when this mode is
enabled. It cannot actually be used as a separator."
