# crm-custom.el --- Alternate `completing-read-multiple` that uses `completing-read`

## Short version

Enable `crm-custom-mode` and `ido-ubiquitous-mode` to get ido
completion for `completing-read-multiple`!

## Longer version

If you use a custom completion mechanism such as
`ido-ubiquitous-mode`, you might notice that functions like
`describe-face` don't use it. This is because they use a function
called `completing-read-multiple` to read multiple values at once, and
this function doesn't use the standard completion mechanisms. This
package allows you to use the standard completion mechanisms to
replace `completing-read-multiple`, allowing your custom completion
system to work for functions that use it.

When you turn on `crm-custom-mode`, any command that uses
`completing-read-multiple` will now prompt you again each time you
enter an item. This is because it is reading a list of multiple
items. To end the completion and finish the list of items, simply
enter an empty string.
